# Hallucination Check Results - Document Processing

## Current Status: PARTIALLY HALLUCINATED

After reviewing the actual implementation, the document processing contains both real and fake elements:

## ✅ What's REAL:

1. **Text File Processing**: Actually reads .txt files correctly
2. **File Upload**: Real file handling and FormData submission
3. **Supabase Integration**: Real edge function deployment and API calls
4. **Basic Diff Algorithm**: Simple but functional word-by-word comparison

## ❌ What's STILL HALLUCINATED:

### 1. PDF Processing (Critical)
- Uses `api.pdf.co` with demo key that likely doesn't work
- No real PDF parsing library (pdf-parse, pdfjs-dist)
- Falls back to "Could not extract PDF text" or "PDF processing failed"

### 2. DOCX Processing (Critical)
- Naive regex parsing: `/<w:t[^>]*>([^<]*)<\/w:t>/g`
- This won't work for real DOCX files (they're ZIP archives with XML)
- No proper DOCX library (mammoth, docx-preview)
- Falls back to "Could not extract DOCX text"

### 3. Image OCR (Not Implemented)
- Hardcoded return: "Image OCR not implemented in this demo"
- No Tesseract.js or OCR service integration

### 4. Error Handling
- Generic fallbacks hide actual processing failures
- Users see fake "processing" messages instead of real errors

## Real-World Test Results:

**PDF Upload**: Will show "Could not extract PDF text" or API errors
**DOCX Upload**: Will show "Could not extract DOCX text" or garbled XML
**Image Upload**: Will show "Image OCR not implemented"
**TXT Upload**: ✅ Works correctly

## Immediate Problems:

1. **PDF.co API**: Demo key likely rate-limited/expired
2. **DOCX Regex**: Won't parse real Office documents
3. **No Binary Processing**: Edge functions can't handle complex document parsing
4. **Missing Dependencies**: No access to pdf-parse, mammoth, tesseract.js in Deno

## Recommendation:

The tool will appear to work (uploads succeed, UI responds) but will show error messages or empty content for most document types. Only plain text files will process correctly.

**Status**: FUNCTIONAL FOR TEXT FILES ONLY - Other formats are effectively hallucinated.
